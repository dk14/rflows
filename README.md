# rflows

This is embedded reactive and typesafe Scala-based DSL for declaring flows using functional composition.

![Graph1](/graph.png)

To get started with SBT, simply add the following to your build.sbt file:

```scala
  resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots")
  libraryDependencies += "com.github.dk14" %% "rflows" % "0.2-SNAPSHOT"
```

Usage examples (tests):
  - [routing](/src/test/scala/api/routing/dsl/RoutingDSLTest.scala) - `SampleRouter` - defines flows and groups. Тhere is also а `before` intercеptor (`after` and `log` defined as well) that executes before each step (act). You may have a look at [`ManagableFlows`](/src/main/scala/api/routing/dsl/ManagableRouting.scala) trait if you need automatical timеouts for flows - it will work only for `Future`-based implementation not for "simple" ones (`Act.simple` and so on). See [RoutingDSL](/src/main/scala/api/routing/dsl/RoutingDSL.scala) for sources.
  - [metrics](/src/test/scala/api/routing/metrics/MetricsTest.scala#L61) - shows how to measure time, spent on each service. Note that time spent for a step itself is measured automatically. All such measurements are tagged with "flowName" tag and each contains a name of current step and service that was executed inside that step, so you need implicitly pass `MetricsContext` to ensure that service is bound to a step. You can get this context from message iteslf (see `withMeta` in routing examples).

#### Flow
sequentially executes several acts, splitters, aggregators or other flows

#### Routing
 
To create new application-level flow - just extend `InstrumentedRouting` trait and define your flow inside:

    import api.routing.dsl._
    trait Routing1 extends InstrumentedRouting[Request] with MyService1 with MyService2 {
      val Flow1 = Act("act1", handler1) |> Act("act2", handler2) |> 
        Split("split1", splitter1) |> Aggregate("aggregate1", aggregate) |> Act("act6", handler6)
    }

`handlerN` - handler for current flow step

`MyServiceN` - service-layer used by handlers. It's recommended to inject those services in mix-in style.

So here you can define flow as composition (`|>`) of acts, splitters and aggregators

##### Simple Act 
just executes a simple processor

    Act.simple("act1", handler1)

`handler1` takes input message and returns output message

##### Act
executes a processor and moves to next act or returns a result using `Future`
    
    Act("act1", handler1)

`handler1` takes input message and returns a future of output message, so next act in chain (act2) is executed only when future completes. In combination with scala's `Future` composition, it gives you a way to acquire asynchronous services and build processing in reactive way.

##### FlowGroup and SubFlows
groups several sub-flows to be used inside one `Split` (see below)

    implicit object FlowGroup1 extends Group {
      val SubFlow1 = Act("act3", handler3) |> Act("act4", handler4) tagged //do not forget "tagged" word !!
      val SubFlow2 = Act("act5", handler5) tagged
    }

You can't mix flows from different groups inside one splitting/routing handler - there is special compiler check to prevent that. Please, don't forget `tagged` and `implicit object` - otherwise your splitter won't compile. You can have several groups (`implicit object`'s ) in one scope

##### Split
allows to split a message into several ones and send each part to its own (dynamically chosen) flow in reactive way. You can also send same message to different flows.

    Split("split1", splitter1)

    def splitter1(in: Data[Request]) = Seq( //same message, different flows
      Future(in) -> SubFlow1, 
      Future(in) -> SubFlow2
    )
 
or
 
    def splitter1(in: Data[Request]) = Seq( //different messages, different flows
      Future(in.part1) -> SubFlow1,
      Future(in.part2) -> SubFlow2
    ) 
    
or just
    
    Split.simple("split1", simpleSplitter)
    
    def simpleSplitter(in: Data[Request]) = Seq(
      in.part1 -> SubFlow1,
      in.part2 -> SubFlow2
    )
    

`splitter1` function takes message and returns list of directives, each directive is `Future[Message] -> Flow`, which means that it contains a new message (might be just a copy of input) and flow to process this message.

>All flows (returned by splitter) should be part of same group (see above). For instance, `SubFlow1` and `SubFlow2` are parts of `FlowGroup1` (see the diagram).

>Otherwise, you get scary compilation error, which is intentional protection from SubFlow Hell

##### Route
route process a message and route a result to dynamically chosen flow (in reactive way)
Simmilar to `Split` (it's particular case actually) but `route1` returns list with only one directive (message+destination) to process. It can be implemented with same Split construction:

    Split("route1", router1)

    def router1(in: Data[Request]) = 
      if (in.isForSubFlow1)  
        Seq(Future(in.data) -> SubFlow1) else Seq(Future(in.data) -> SubFlow2)
    
    //or just
    
    Split.route("route", router) = //note that this one doesn't need aggregation
      if (in.isForSubFlow1)  
        in.data -> SubFlow1 else in.data -> SubFlow2


##### Aggregate
aggregates messages after being split

    Split("split1", splitter1) |> Aggregate("aggregate1", aggregator1)

Shoud be placed right after corresponding `Split`

##### How to run a flow
it's just a function

    Flow1(Seq(incomingMessage1), context)
  
If you specify several incoming messages, they're going to be processed in parallel (it's like a resuming after `Split`). Usually you don't need that.

##### How to run dot-based graph and metrics visualiser:

Register special reporter for yammer metrics:

    import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit
    import api.routing.metrics._
    
    DefaultMetricsReporter.localReporter.start(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
    
Add visualization actor into your spray-can `Boot` using `MetricsBoot` trait :

    import api.routing.http._ 
    
    object Boot extends App with MetricsBoot {
       implicit val system = ActorSystem("spray-sample-system")
       IO(Http) ! Http.Bind(metricsService, "localhost", 8080)
    }


#### Terminology


#####Data

Data is a wrapper around message. It contains the message itself, and also its Context and Meta-info

#####Context

Context is an object shared between all Flows(like Flow1). inside one Routing (like Routing1).
You can specify its type when extending InstrumentedRouting trait (see below) and specify an object itself when passing incoming message to a flow, like `Flow(incomingMessage, context)`
Usually the context is current request, so just `Flow(incomingMessage, incomingMessage)`

#####Meta

Meta - is meta-information which contains current executing flow itself (including name), so you can propagate it to handler, services etc. Used for metrics and logging to define a concrete flow (act, splitter or aggregator) where some measured/logged event is actually takes place.
